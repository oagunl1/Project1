Test cases will be graded as follows:
	2 points for correct output
	1-2 points for mostly correct output
	0-1 points for partially correct output
	0 points for no output / can not run

Test1.txt
A simple test case with a .txt extension to test that your
compiler only accepts .gtx files.

Test2.gtx
A simple test case containing only markdown annotations (i.e., 
no variable tags) to test that the compiler works properly for a
simple case.  

Test3.gtx
A simple test case containing only markdown annotations (i.e., 
no variable tags) with some annotations in lower case to test 
that the compiler is not case sensitive. Also includes bold and
italicized text. 

Test4.gtx
A simple test case containing invalid markdown annotations to
test that the lexical analyzer recognizes unknown lexemes and
reports them as lexical errors. 

Test5.gtx
A simple test case containing a single, defined variable tag to 
test that the compiler works properly for a variable in a 
simple case. Taken from example in project handout. 

Test6.gtx
A simple test case containing a single, undefined variable to 
test that the compiler detects the use of an unknown variable. Should
report a static semantic error.  

Test7.gtx
A test case to test the scoping of a variable. Taken from the
suggested test cases in the project handout. 

Test8.gtx 
A test case to ensure if there are annotations after \END 
are reported as syntax errors.

Test9.gtx
A test case using multiple variable definition and use tags to 
ensure that the parser can handle multiple variables.

Test10.gtx
A test case with legal annotations not following the grammar to
test that the parser is enforcing the grammar rules. Should
report a syntax error.
